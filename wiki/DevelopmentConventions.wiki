= Introduction =

Cadmos development follows a number of conventions that are documented in this page.

= Format =
If you have a properly set-up development environment (see DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup) most format issues are automatically handled by eclipse.   

Eclipse's automatic code formatter and save actions are enabled for each project in the background by using a common {{{./settings}}} directory.
This directory is included by {{{svn:externals}}} and formatter and save actions are maintained in the *default-project*.

Here are some key points concerning the format:
 * Blank line before field or method declaration.
 * Always use blocks {{{{...}}}} in {{{for}}}, {{{while}}} and {{{if}}} statements.
 * Use {{{final}}} for fields and local varaibles where possible.
 * Remove unnecessary casts.
 * Remove trailing whitespace from all lines.
