#summary How to set up a development environment for Cadmos.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
The target audience of this page are developers that extend and maintain the Cadmos code base.
This page describes the steps to set up a working development environment. 

= Prerequisites =
Cadmos is developed using new Java 7 language features like inferred type parameters (e.g {{{Set<String> names = new HashSet<>();}}}), so you need a Java 7 runtime or SDK on the development machine, e.g. available at [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html] .

= Install Eclipse e4 =
Cadmos has a _"pure Java"_ *core* part and an eclipse e4 based *ui* part.
Eclipse e4 has build-in full Java 7 support starting from version 4.1.1, which can be downloaded and installed for many platforms and operating systems from [http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/] . 

= Install Subclipse =
Cadmos uses SVN for version control, which is supported by several client integrations for eclipse.
We use a eclipse SVN client called *subclipse*.

You can use this eclipse update manager url to install subclipse 1.8.x: [http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x]
