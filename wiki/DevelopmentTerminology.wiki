=== Component ===
A component defines function that maps _messages_ received on incoming channels to messages sent on outgoing channels.
The function of a component is also called the _behavior_ of the component.
The behavior of a component is either defined directly by a _non-deterministic transition machine_ or it is defined by the composed behavior of several _children_ components.
This hierarchical parent-children relation describes the _structure_ of a system.

=== Channel ===
A channel represents a stream of _messages_ transmitted from a source component to a destination component.
A channel is _outbound_ to the _system boundary_ if its destination component is undefined.
A channel is _inbound_ from the _system boundary_ if its source component is undefined.
If a channel is neither outbound nor inbound, it can only _connect_ two components that belong to the same parent component.
Furthermore, a channel can buffer messages by a certain _delay_, so a message sent by the source component at step _i_ will be received by the destination component at step _i + delay_.
A channel with a given buffer length of _delay_ also requires _delay_ initial messages for this buffer.
