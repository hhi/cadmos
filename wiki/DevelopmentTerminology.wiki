=== Component ===
A component defines function that maps messages of incoming channels to messages on outgoing channels.
This function of a component is also called the _behavior_ of the component.
The behavior of a component is either defined directly by a non-deterministic transition machine or it is defined by the composed behavior of several _children_ components.
This hierarchical parent-children relation describes the _structure_ of a system.
