## What is Cadmos ? ##
Cadmos is a model-based architecture specification language accompanied by a set of eclipse plug-ins, views and extensions to visualize, analyze, transform and deploy architecture models of parallel software systems.

## Who is working on Cadmos ? ##
Cadmos is developed by the [model-based development research group](http://www4.in.tum.de/research/modeldriven/index_en.shtml) of the [Chair IV - Software & Systems Engineering](http://www4.in.tum.de/index_en.shtml) at the [Technische Universität München (TUM)](http://www.in.tum.de/), Germany.

## Why should I be interested in Cadmos ? ##
The Cadmos project is mainly research-focused at the moment.
Future extensions should allow for integration with industrial modeling tools.
The development of Cadmos is driven by the different focuses of several research projects ([ARAMiS](http://www.projekt-aramis.de/), [SPES2020](http://spes2020.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/), [SPES\_XT](http://spes2020.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/spes_xt-home.html)).
This includes the following topics:
  * Specification of hierarchical systems-of-systems
  * Formal methods for safety-critical embedded software systems
  * Model-based development and automation of allocation, scheduling, code-generation and deployment
  * Multicore- and manycore-based cyber physical systems

## When will Cadmos milestones and releases appear? ##
A prototype of Cadmos with new hierarchical data-flow analysis features is under active development at TUM at the moment.
This prototype is scheduled to be available for download (from source) in December 2012.
